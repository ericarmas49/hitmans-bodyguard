            There comes a time in almost every guy&rsquo;s life when you meet someone and slowly begin to wonder how you ever could have lived without them. They&rsquo;re someone who&rsquo;s there for you for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health. We&rsquo;re talking, of course, about your best bro.  
            <br/><br/>
            There&rsquo;s a word for this kind of relationship; it&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;bromance,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s the reason Judd Apatow has the net worth that he does.
            <br/><br/>
            In the new action flick &ldquo;The Hitman&rsquo;s Bodyguard,&rdquo; Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson blossom an explosive bromance a la Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon, or Riggs & Murtaugh from ‘Lethal Weapon&rsquo;. Their chemistry as best Bros, however, isn&rsquo;t lightning in a bottle. Like any relationship, a bromance can be difficult to maintain, but it&rsquo;s actually pretty simple if you follow these tips.

            If you&rsquo;re not constantly looking out for your bro&mdash; and if he&rsquo;s not doing the same– your relationship is more of a fauxmance than a bromance. There&rsquo;s a very slim chance that you&rsquo;ll ever have to deal with the wrath of a ruthless dictator who&rsquo;s dispatched a veritable army to hunt you down, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t always be watching each other&rsquo;s backs.
            <br/><br/>
            In many cases, this means doing the right thing when your bro is doing the wrong thing. Let&rsquo;s say your bro has a tendency to get into fights with inanimate objects when he&rsquo;s had a little too much to drink.  If you&rsquo;re out and sense he&rsquo;s nearing the point of no return, offer to buy the next round, go to the bar, order a Coke, and tell him it&rsquo;s a double whiskey-Coke. A true hero needs no recognition.

            Sometimes it isn&rsquo;t just enough to watch your bro&rsquo;s back&mdash;there are certain times when you have to jump into the line of fire, knowing he&rsquo;ll do the same when the time comes. Selflessness and sacrifice are core tenets of any stable bromance.
            <br/><br/>
            Taking a bullet means taking the blame for when your bro wakes his girlfriend up after getting home at 3 AM&mdash; even if it was his idea to hit up that sketchy bar that closes late. Taking a bullet means helping him move his stuff out of a fourth-floor walk-up after that girlfriend finally gets fed up with his shit. Taking a bullet means agreeing to help put together the dresser he bought from IKEA for his new place&mdash; the ultimate test of any relationship. Taking a bullet can be manifested in a number of ways, but it means that you&rsquo;re always there.

            At some point, your bro is going to go through a rough patch. Maybe he got laid off for doing nothing wrong besides agreeing to be an at-will employee. Maybe his girlfriend left him for a SoulCycle instructor with neck tattoos. Maybe he realized his generation was promised an American dream that will never be realized thanks to the policies instituted by the ones who came before. Regardless of the catalyst, he&rsquo;s going to be kind of a downer to be around.
            <br/><br/>
            When this happens, you have a couple of options. You can either hope he gets over himself without your help or you can channel your inner sherpa and ensure he gets to where he needs to be. When your bro falters in the face of adversity, be the Sam to his Frodo and make sure he gets back on his (hopefully less hairy) feet.

            As mentioned above, many of the rules that apply to a traditional relationship also apply to a bromance, and making sure you have some quality one-on-one time with each other is one of the most vital elements of a successful one. It&rsquo;s easy to channel your inner network sitcom and surround yourself with a group of good friends at virtually all times, but specifically making time for each other is an essential element of a true bromance (not to be confused with the Quentin Tarantino movie).
            <br/><br/>
            There are countless ways for you and your bro to spend quality time together. Take advantage of the endless apps at a TGI Fridays. Rent out a karaoke room and exclusively do duets. Stock up on dollar bills and go to the one and only place where a pocket full of singles can come in handy&mdash; a dive bar with Big Buck Hunter in the back. The opportunities are endless.

            There&rsquo;s a point in almost every bromance when a third person will enter the picture who threatens to destroy everything you&rsquo;ve built together. When you feel yourself becoming the third wheel, it can be incredibly tempting to do everything in your power to drive a wedge into the new relationship in order to maintain the status quo. However, that just makes you the equivalent of a 10-year-old product of a broken marriage who&rsquo;s not happy about dad&rsquo;s new &ldquo;special friend.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t want to be that person.
            <br/><br/>
            Unless you get the sense your bro&rsquo;s girlfriend is a literal succubus sent from the depths of hell to devour his soul, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to do everything and anything you can to support him&mdash; especially if things aren&rsquo;t going smoothly. If you sense your bro&rsquo;s relationship is on the rocks, use what you&rsquo;ve learned from your bromance to help smooth things over.
            <br/><br/>
            With that said, not every relationship is meant to last. If you truly think your bro is with someone who needs to go, it&rsquo;s on you to let him know. Just make sure you&rsquo;re ready for the consequences if you don&rsquo;t see eye-to-eye.

            If you&rsquo;re in a stable bromance, you shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem being candid with your bro. You should feel free to openly air your grievances like every day is Festivus. The last thing you want to do is fail to address an issue because you&rsquo;re afraid of how your bro will react.
            <br/><br/>
            Everyone needs a reality check at some point, and it&rsquo;s your job to let your bro know when it&rsquo;s his turn. Be blunt. Be honest. Be real. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched an episode of &ldquo;Intervention,&rdquo; you should be more than prepared to do what you need to do.

            If you follow all the steps listed above, you should be able to forge a bromance just like the one Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson have on display in &ldquo;The Hitman&rsquo;s Bodyguard.&rdquo; In the movie, Ryan Reynolds plays the titular bodyguard who is tasked with protecting the life of a hitman played by Samuel L. Jackson, marking what may be the first time in movie history Samuel L. Jackson has needed help to stay alive.
            <br/><br/>
            Over the course of the film, their friendship is put to the test, but they manage to keep things together under fire&mdash; both figuratively and literally. It&rsquo;s a bromance for the ages, and you can have one just like it as long as you subscribe to this guide.
